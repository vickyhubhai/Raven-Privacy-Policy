**Effective Date:** May 20, 2025  
**Bot Name:** Raven  
**Developer Contact:** [spectrummm99@gmail.com] or [https://discord.gg/user/]

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how Raven ("the Bot", "we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and protects data when you use it in your Discord server. By adding or interacting with Raven, you agree to the practices described here.

## 2. Information We Collect

Raven may collect and temporarily store the following types of data:

- **Server IDs and Channel IDs:** Used to store server-specific settings and preferences.
- **User IDs:** Collected when users issue commands, used for command tracking and moderation logs.
- **Message Content (limited to commands):** Only messages that invoke the bot (e.g., with a prefix or slash command) may be processed.
- **Bot Monitoring Data:** If Raven tracks bot statuses, it may store status or uptime info.

We do **not** collect or store direct messages, uninvoked message content, or personal information such as emails or names.

## 3. How We Use the Information

The data we collect is used strictly to:

- Operate the bot’s features (e.g., moderation, logging, status tracking).
- Maintain server-specific configurations.
- Provide statistics and uptime reports (if applicable).

We **do not sell**, rent, or share any data with third parties.

## 4. Data Storage and Security

All stored data is hosted securely on servers managed by the developer. Access is restricted and monitored to prevent unauthorized use. If third-party hosting (e.g., MongoDB, hosting panels) is used, it complies with standard data protection practices.

## 5. Data Retention and Deletion

Raven retains data only as long as it is necessary for bot operation. If a user or server owner wishes to delete data associated with their server or user ID, they may request deletion via the contact methods below.

Requests for data deletion will be honored within **7 days**.

## 6. Children's Privacy

Raven is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 7. Third-Party Services

Raven relies on the following third-party services:
- **Discord API** (for core bot functionality)

These services have their own privacy policies. We encourage users to review them.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Changes will be posted in this repository and indicated by a new “Effective Date”.
